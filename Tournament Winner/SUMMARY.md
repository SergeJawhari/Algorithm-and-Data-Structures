HashTables and Looping Maximum: O(n^2) time | O(k) space
    my take on this problem, it is effective, however not efficient as the dictionary must be looped in order to find the maximum value at the end.

HashTables and Updating Scores: O(n) time | O(k) space
    more efficient since the current best team is being updated in constant time.
